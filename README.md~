# PTSD reversal project

Threat reversal learning in combat veterans with and without PTSD

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In order to run the analyses locally on your machine, you will need a
bunch of software packages installed:

* R
* Matlab
* emacs
* org-mode
* ESS (emacs speaks statistics)
* TeXlive and XeTeX
* latex2rtf
* pdfcrop
* pdftk

### Installing

Once the prerequisites are met, running the analyses should be
straightforward. There is Makefile included in the repository.

## Running the analyses 

### Analyses

make analyses

#### A note on reproducibility of the Hierarchical Bayes estimation

The code will produce the expected results, but you won't be able to
reset that reproducibility within a session. The reason for this is
the behavior of the pseudo random number generator (PRNG). The
expose_stan_functions() function only sets the seed the first time a
user-defined function ending in _rng is called. You can't change its
seed afterwards within the same R session because it is declared
static. This behavior is documented in the Details section of
?expose_stan_functions.
